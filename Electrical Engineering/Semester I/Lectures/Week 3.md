## Ideal and real circuit elements. Power Balance.
**Ideal circuit elements** do not exist, but they are useful to analyse (model) the real circuit elements. 
Ideal circuit element has a *relation* between voltage at the terminals and the current through the element.
```u=f(i)```

**An ideal circuit element** is a *resistive* element if the ecuation between voltage and current is algebraic one.
 ```u=f(i)```
**An ideal circuit element** is a *reactive* element if the ecuation between voltage and current is differential one.
```u=df(i)/dt```
It can be also *passive* if it does note generate energy but it consumes power.

## The characteristics of a resistor
**The resistor** is one port element where the voltage and the current have an imposed relation. The voltage depends on the current.
