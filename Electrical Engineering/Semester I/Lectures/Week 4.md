## Lecture II: Equivalence of circuit elements
![[Week 4 2023-10-24 10.32.36.excalidraw]]
Two elements are **equivalent** to each other if the elements have the same voltage and the same currents at the terminals.

The two elements are **equivalent** if they have the same *dependence* between current and voltage.

In a circuit we can replace one element with another element that's **equivalent** to the first without changing the graph of current and voltages.

### The Theorem of real voltage source and real current source

RVS is equivalent to RCS if:

## Equivalence of series real voltage sources
RVS series
![[Week 4 2023-10-24 10.48.51.excalidraw]]
Rs=Sum of Rk
Es=Sum of Ek
(orientation matters!!!)

#### Particular cases
1) Ek=0; k=1,n
	R=SumRk
	![[Week 4 2023-10-24 11.08.55.excalidraw]]
2)  Rk=0; k=1,n
	E=SumRk
