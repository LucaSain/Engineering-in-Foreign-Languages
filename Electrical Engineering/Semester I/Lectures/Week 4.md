### Next we apply Tellegen's theorem

```Pc=Pg```

### Example of application

## Lecture II: Equivalence of circuit elements
![[Week 4 2023-10-24 10.32.36.excalidraw]]
Two elements are **equivalent** to each other if the elements have the same voltage and the same currents at the terminals.

The two elements are **equivalent** if they have the same *dependence* between current and voltage.

In a circuit we can replace one element with another element that's **equivalent** to the first without changing the graph of current and voltages.

### The Theorem of real voltage source and real current source

RVS is equivalent to RCS if:

## Equivalence of series real voltage sources
RVS series
![[Week 4 2023-10-24 10.48.51.excalidraw]]
Rs=Sum of Rk
Es=Sum of Ek
(orientation matters!!!)

#### Particular cases
1) Ek=0; k=1,n
	R=SumRk
	![[Week 4 2023-10-24 11.08.55.excalidraw]]
2)  Rk=0; k=1,n
	E=SumRk
	![[Week 4 2023-10-24 11.10.49.excalidraw]]

## Equivalence of real voltage sources connected in parallel
![[Week 4 2023-10-24 11.14.49.excalidraw]]
#### Particular cases
1) Ek=0, k=1,n => 1/R = Sum(1/Rk)
2) An ideal voltage source connected in parallel with any kind of element but not an IVS is equivalent with that ideal voltage source.
3) R1=R2=0 => R=0
	But E1,E2 IVSs, E1!=E2, but U=E1, U=E2 => E1=E2 -> Contradiction => wrong problem
	If E1=E2 no contradiction but we cannot compute all the solutions of the circuit
	WE CANNOT CONNECT IN PARALEL TWO IVS's, real can be^^
