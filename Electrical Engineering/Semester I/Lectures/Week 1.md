# Lecture I - Topology of Electrical Circuits (TEC)

### Definition
Electrical Circuits represent a set of circuit elements connected at *terminals*
The circuit element is a physical domain whose interaction with the outside environment is done only by some terminals placed on its surface

## Classification:
Two terminals ( one port elements)

### Representation - Graphs
A graphs of circuits is a set of points named *nodes* which are the terminals of elements connected by oriented curves named *branches* which are the circuit elements.
The form is not important, only the connection maters.

The Branch
	letter b, b = 1,B. B = total number of elements.
	A branch is incident to a node.
	b âˆˆ (n)

Node
	letter (n), n = 1,N. N = total number of nodes.
	A node is the point of intersection of at least three branches

Loop
	letter L (small). l=1,2,...
	We do not care how many loops there are.
	A branch b âˆˆ l

### Representation  - section (cut-set)
Notation - {S}
The section is a set of branches by whose elimination the graph is divided into two independent parts
It has an orientation, like the loop.

### Representation - Tree (Arbore)

The tree is a set of branches which connect all the nodes of the circuit without making a loop.
The branch of a tree is called **twig**.
The total number of **twigs** = N-1.
Pro advice - select the simplest tree.

A co-tree are is made of all the branches that are not twigs.
The branches are called **Chords**
B - N + 1 are chords.

A twig generates a cut-set, a section. The rest of the branches are chords.
A chord generates a loop. In a loop there is only one chord, the rest of the branches are twigs.
The system of cut-set or section generated by twigs represent a system of independent or fundamental section (or cut-set aha)

1 twig generate 1 section
N-1 twigs generate N-1 section

A system of loops generated by chords represents a system of independent loops.

B-N+1 chords generated B-N+1 independent loops.

### Special rules for the graphs
1. Chose a tree (N-1 twigs)
2. Order the branches. First the twigs and then the chords: 1,2,...,N-1 - twigs; N,N+1,...,B - chords.
3. N-1 twigs will generate N-1 sections (1st twig -> 1st section etc)
4. Generate the system of independent loops using the chords. B-N+1 chords will generate B-N+1 loops (1st chord -> 1st loop)
