### How does your cultural orientation map help you in your life?
By completing a cultural orientation map I reflected on my values preached inside a team. Thus, I can clearly see in what team I am fitting the best, what values my teammates should have and, most importantly, I can foresee any uncomfortable situation such that I'll be as efficient and useful in a workflow as can I be.

### How does your cultural orientation map hold you back in your life?

Well, I believe it doesn't quite **hold me back** because of my growth oriented mindset. The map can only help me see all the good and all the bad traits I can manifest in a team-based environment. 

### Which traits are difficult for you to deal with in other people?
To really think about it, I can't quite stand people who do not put at least some minimal effort into an team activity. However, to some degree I can accept that I could have made something or could have talked in some way so these people would have been motivated to share their interest. Nonetheless, I believe I have something to learn from everyone.
