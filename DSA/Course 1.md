## Abstract Data Types
It's a collection of axioms and operations
Operations
	what actions can be performed on the data type. For each operation we know:
		name
		arguments
		return type

Axioms are rules between operations
We do not know the information about the implementation of operations
Similar to Java interfaces

### Examples
* Stack
	* Operations: push, pop, peek, isEmpty


# Introduction to C/C++
* Similar to Java
* The basic structure of a C program
	Inclusion of headers
	Definition of types/classes
	Declaration of global variables
	Definition of functions
	The main functions
*Example here*
```c
#include <stuff>
int a,b,c;
int main(){
	a=10;
	scanf("%d",&b);
	c=a+b;
	printf("%d\n",c);
	return 0;
}
```

### Transition to C++
C++ is a superset of language C.
*c code can be compiled by a c++ compiler, but the c cannot compile c++ code*
c follows procedural programming, no OOP.
c++ can do both ðŸ’ª
c++: namespaces

*Example here*
```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
	int a;
	cin>>a;
	cout<<a;
	return 0;
}
```
