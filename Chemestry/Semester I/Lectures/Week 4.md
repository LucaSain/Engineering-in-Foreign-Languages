## Lecture 4 - Materials

### Materials based on covalent bonds
* Diamond
	is a transparent crystal of tetrahedrally bonded atmos in a covalent cattice (sp3) that crystallizes into diamon lattice whici is a variation of the face centered cubic structure
* Graphite
	is a allotrope of carbon. Graphite is the most stable form of carbon under standard conditions
	The highest grade of coal
* Graphene
	flat moonlayer of carbon
	0d fullerenes
	1d nanotubes
	3d graphite
* Fullerene
	buckminsterfullerenes in full are molecules composed entirely of carbon, taking the for
