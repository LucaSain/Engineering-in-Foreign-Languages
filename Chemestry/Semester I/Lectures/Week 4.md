## Lecture 4 - Materials

### Materials based on covalent bonds
* Diamond
	is a transparent crystal of tetrahedrally bonded atmos in a covalent cattice (sp3) that crystallizes into diamon lattice whici is a variation of the face centered cubic structure
* Graphite
	is a allotrope of carbon. Graphite is the most stable form of carbon under standard conditions
	The highest grade of coal
* Graphene
	flat moonlayer of carbon
	0d fullerenes
	1d nanotubes
	3d graphite
* Fullerene
	buckminsterfullerenes in full are molecules composed entirely of carbon, taking the for

Two types of **semiconductors**:
1. **Intrinsic**
	Semiconductors from chemical bounds
2. **Extrinsic**
	semiconductors where some impurity has been intentionally added in the solid state in order to increase in conductivity. The impurities govern the props of the semiconductor.

**Doping** is done in the range of ppm(parts per milion)concentrations (mg/kg), but may be up to a few g/kg. A semiconductor doped to several g/kg level has a conductivity to that of a poor metal.
