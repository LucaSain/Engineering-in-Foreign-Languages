Let v be a real vector space. We denote by CV the set of formal combinations of type v+iw, where i=âˆš-1
Show that CV is a complex vector space, with the following operations:
	Whatever v + iw from C, v1+iw1 and whatever a = a+ib from C
	(v+iw) + (v1+iw1) =def= (v+v1,i(w+w1))
	a(v+iw) =def= (av,iaw)
	a) CV = abelian group
	b) z from CV,  a,b from C => (a+b)z = az+bz
		(a+b)z=(a+b)(v+wi)=(a+b)v+(a+b)wi=av+bv+awi+bwi= a(v+wi)+b(v+wi)=az+bz
	c) let z1,z2 from CV and a from C such that (z1+z2)a=z1a+z2a
	...
	d) let a,b from C and z from CV such that (ab)z=a(bz):
	<=> (ab)(v+wi) = a(b((v+wi))) <=> (abv,iabw)=a(bv,+)
