Prove that 
1) K is a vector space over itself, with addition and multiplication in K;
	a) (K,+) abelian group (K=field)
	b) let  x form K , a,b from K; from a) => (a+b)x=ax+bx
	c) let v,w from K, a from K, (v+w)a = va + wa
	d) let a,b from K, v from K, (ab)v = a(bv), v-vector
	e) It exists 1k in K; let v from K, 1kv=v
	**=>** k is a vector space over itself, "+,multiplication"
	
1) K^3 is a vector space, where K^3 = {(x1,x2,x3)|x1,x2,x3 from K}is endowed with
