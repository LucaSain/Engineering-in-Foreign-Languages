# Grading
Minpoints = 50 points
* Seminar: 30 points
	+ 10 points homework
	+ 10 points Test 1
	+ 10 points Test 2
	+ extra points for answers and activity
+ Midterm: 35 points
+ Final: 35 points
	+ 2h for Final exam
	+ afterwards the midterm can be re-taken
	+ No threshold, no min points.
	+ You are not obliged to come for the results
	+ If you need 5 extra points to raise the mark (eg from 52 to 6) just come and answer a question 😩🥳🏐

Both exams are split:
* Theory: 15 points
* Problem 1: 10 points
* Problem 2: 10 points
* For Midterm: you can repeat the theory and the problems. If you want to repeat only one problem you must have in the other one 50% of the points.

# Important stuff
$$\displaylines{q(Q)[C] \\ \vec{E}[v/m] \\ \vec{B}[T] \\ \vec{p} \space electric \space moment \\ \vec{m} \space electric \space momentum \\ i(A)}$$
From $q$ we get the $q_l, q_s, q_v$.
From $\vec{p}$ we get $\vec{P}$ polarisation
From $\vec{m}$ we get $\vec{M}$ magnetisation
