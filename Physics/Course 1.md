It's about optics and electromagnetic waves.

# Electromagnetic waves
**Definition** A wave is a propagating *disturbance* in space in time.
According to the type of disturbance we can identify several types of waves:
* Electromagnetic waves
	* This types of waves do not need a support. They can propagate in a vacuum. Transverse waves. They are the propagation in space and time of electric and magnetic fields.
* Mechanic waves (like sound)
* Matter waves (gravitational waves)
According to the direction of dispersion of waves there are:
* Longitudinal (along the direction of propagation)
* Transverse (perpendicular to the direction of propagation)

We initially thought that light is a elastic wave. Then we observed that it propagates through air. So we created a conceptual matter called *[ether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminiferous_aether#:~:text=Luminiferous%20aether%20or%20ether%20(luminiferous,not%20be%20able%20to%20do.)*.


# Electromagnetic waves
Electromagnetic fields are generated by a electromagnetic charge.

Electric fields are produced by charges.
**The field lines:**

Electric field force:
$$\vec{F}=\frac{Qq_t}{4\pi\epsilon_0r^2}\cdot\frac{\vec{r}}{r}$$
Electric field intensity:
$$\vec{E}=\frac{\vec{F}}{}$$
