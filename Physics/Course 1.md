It's about optics and electromagnetic waves.

# Electromagnetic waves
**Definition** A wave is a propagating *disturbance* in space in time.
According to the type of disturbance we can identify several types of waves:
* Electromagnetic waves
	* This types of waves do not need a support. They can propagate in a vacuum. Transverse waves. They are the propagation in space and time of electric and magnetic fields.
* Mechanic waves (like sound)
* Matter waves (gravitational waves)
According to the direction of dispersion of waves there are:
* Longitudinal (along the direction of propagation)
* Transverse (perpendicular to the direction of propagation)

We initially thought that light is a elastic wave. Then we observed that it propagates through air. So we created a conceptual matter called *[ether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminiferous_aether#:~:text=Luminiferous%20aether%20or%20ether%20(luminiferous,not%20be%20able%20to%20do.)*.

# Electromagnetic waves
Electromagnetic fields are generated by a electromagnetic charge.
![[Course 1 2024-02-29 10.38.51.excalidraw]]
Electric fields are produced by charges.
**The field lines:**
![[Course 1 2024-02-29 10.40.27.excalidraw]]
Electric field force:
$$\vec{F}=\frac{Qq_t}{4\pi\epsilon_0r^2}\cdot\frac{\vec{r}}{r}$$
Electric intensity:
$$\vec{E}=\frac{\vec{F}}{q_t}$$
Electric induction:
$$\vec{D}=\epsilon_0\vec{E}$$
Magnetic induction:
$$\displaylines{\vec{B}=\vec{B}(\vec{r},t) \\ B=\mu_0\frac{I}{2\pi r}}$$
Magnetic intensity:
$$\vec{H}=\frac{\vec{B}}{\mu_0}$$
Electric force
$$\vec{F}_{el}=q\vec{E}$$
Laurenz force
$$\vec{F}_L=q\vec{v}\times\vec{B}$$

Electromagnetic fields are produces by sources of:
* electric field: charges
* mg field: currents (moving charges)

For many years the electric and magnetic phenomena were treated differently.
At some point some experiments showed that the fields can generate each others. The guy who did the great stuff with equations was **Robert Maxwell**.
He was able to obtain a theory of the electromagnetic phenomena.

### Maxwell equations:
_local form_

$$\displaylines{\nabla\vec{E}=\frac{\rho}{\epsilon_o} \\ \nabla \vec{B} = 0 \\ \nabla\times\vec{E}=-\frac{\partial\vec{B}}{\partial t} \\ \nabla \times \ \vec{B} = \mu_o \vec{j} + \epsilon_0\mu_0\frac{\partial\vec{E}}{\partial t} \\ \vec{E}=\vec{E}(\vec{r},t) \\ \vec{B}=\vec{B}(\vec{r,t}) \\ \rho=\frac{dQ}{dV} \\ j=\frac{dI}{dA}}$$

1st Gauss law
The divergence of Electric field

2nd Gauss law 
The divergence of the magnetic field is 0.

3.Electromagnetic induction law:
Time changing the magnetic field produces an electric field.
When the magnetic field is changing there is an electric field produced.
A variable magnetic field produces an electric field

4.**Amper's law**.
The change of the electric field produces a magnetic field.

$\rho$ is the electric charge density
$j$ is the electric charge density. It's defined at each point of the conductor. It is local. *Local* is different from *integral*.

## The wave equation:
Let $\Psi=\Psi(x,t)$
$$
\frac{\partial^2\psi(x,t)}{\partial x^2}-\frac{1}{v^2}\cdot \frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial t^2}=0
$$
_note: the solution to a differential equation is a function._
And we get the wave function:
$$\Psi(x,t)=A\sin(RX-\omega t)$$
$\Psi$ can be ether $E$ or  $B$

$$\displaylines{ \nabla \times (\nabla \times \vec{E}) = \nabla(\nabla\vec{E}) - \nabla^2\vec{E} \\ \nabla = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\vec{u}_x \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\vec{u}_y + \frac{\partial}{\partial z}\vec{u}_z \\ \mathit{divergence: } \nabla\vec{V} = \frac{\partial V_x}{\partial x}+ \frac{\partial V_y}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial V_z}{\partial z} \\ \mathit{curl: } \nabla\times\vec{V}}$$

The equations that are satisfied without the sources (for electromagnetic fields)(example = anthena)
$$\displaylines{\nabla\vec{E}=0 \\ \nabla\vec{B}=0 \\ \nabla\times\vec{E}=-\frac{\partial \vec{V}}{\partial t} \\ \nabla\times\vec{B}=\epsilon_0\mu_0\frac{\partial\vec{E}}{\partial t}}$$

Thus,
$$\nabla(\nabla\vec{E})-\nabla^2\vec{E}$$

Let's write E as a function of x

$$
\displaylines{E=E(x,t) \\ 
\frac{\partial E(x,y)}{\partial x^2}-\epsilon_0\mu_0\frac{\partial^2 E(x,t)}{\partial t^2} \mathit{}
\\
\nabla^2=\Delta \quad and \space it's \space called \space Laplacian
}$$

Maxwell conclusion was that the magnetic fields propagate with a speed:


$$v=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon_0\mu_0}}$$

Homework 1
Show me that B also satisfies an equation of a wave
Homework 2
Demonstrate that the speed is $3\times10^8\frac{m}{s}$
The speed of light.

This has demonstrated that the light has not an elastic nature.
This has proven that the light was of an electromagnetic nature.

Homework 3 w/ assignment.
Write a small essay on the first experiments in which the first electromagnetic waves were produced. Check Hertz's experiments.


Today's efforts are to unify all the types of fields. Check's Einsteins' last words.

**Light is an electromagnetic wave**.

## The electromagnetic wave spectrum
Wavelengths and frequency.
$\lambda=c\times T=\frac{c}{f}$
wavelength is the distance after which the wave repeats itself
T is the time interval after which the wave repeats itself.
f = frequency
*Angular* frequency is $\omega=2\pi f$
The mechanism of producing the waves is the one which determines the type of the way. 
Longest wavelengths and shortest waves are radio waves
Then follows the microwaves
Then there is infrared (heat)
Then visible
Then ultraviolet
Then x rays
Then gamma
