It's about optics and electromagnetic waves.

# Electromagnetic waves
**Definition** A wave is a propagating *disturbance* in space in time.
According to the type of disturbance we can identify several types of waves:
* Electromagnetic waves
	* This types of waves do not need a support. They can propagate in a vacuum.
* Mechanic waves (like sound)
* Matter waves (gravitational waves)

We initially thought that light is a elastic wave. Then we observed that it propagat
