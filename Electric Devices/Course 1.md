# Introduction
## Electronic devices
An electronic device is not linear
Can be a device like a _diode_, _transistor_.
Can be an integrated circuit. Like a full-fledged component.
Electrical systems include resistors, capacitors, inductors = **electrical devices**
All the rules from the FEE1 apply: TK1, TK2 and Ohm's.

The first electronic devices were vacuum tubes.

In a vacuum cube the electrons move easily.

Electronic are the biggest market of the entire world.
Electronics = control of ele tron flow
### Notations:
Voltage, Current and Complex Numbers
$$Voltage(V), Current(I), j=\sqrt{-1}$$

In 1947 the **bipolar junction transistor** was invented
In 1960 the **first integrated circuit** was created
=> MOSFET and other circuits.
