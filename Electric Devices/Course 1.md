# Introduction
## Electronic devices
An electronic device is not linear
Can be a device like a _diode_, _transistor_.
Can be an integrated circuit. Like a full-fledged component.
Electrical systems include resistors, capacitors, inductors = **electrical devices**
All the rules from the FEE1 apply: TK1, TK2 and Ohm's.

The first electronic devices were vacuum tubes.

In a vacuum cube the electrons move easily.

Electronic are the biggest market of the entire world.
Electronics = control of ele tron flow
### Notations:
Voltage, Current and Complex Numbers
$$Voltage(V), Current(I), j=\sqrt{-1}$$

In 1947 the **bipolar junction transistor** was invented
In 1960 the **first integrated circuit** was created
=> MOSFET and other circuits.

### Basic principle of electronics

### Signals
A signal is a waveform that server as a means of communication.

## Notation conventions
(see table)
For DC:
![[Course 1 2024-02-28 08.16.50.excalidraw]]$$i_D=I_s[\exp(\frac{fV_d}{nkT}-1)]$$
For AC:
![[Course 1 2024-02-28 09.34.07.excalidraw]]
$$V_d=ReI_d$$

# Materials and electronic components
**Matter** is composed of **atoms**.
Electrons are arranged i orbits.
Atoms in a solid, crystal structure => 3D periodic array of building blocks.
In a crystal the outer electronic orbits of closed atoms overlap, the valence electrons are neighbours.
The whole crystal remains electrically neutral.

Because we cannot
