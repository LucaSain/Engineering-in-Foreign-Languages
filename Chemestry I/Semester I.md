# Lecture I - Correlation between the chemical structure and the material props

### The atom
Is the small particle characterising a chemical element
A chemical element or element is a type of atom which is defined by its atomic number Z that is given by the numbers of protons in its nucleus
The atom consists of
- nucleus - formed by positive charged protons and electrically neutral neutrons
- larger electron clouds consisting of negatively charged electrons

Z = nop
A = nop + non

Electronic cloud  =>  shells - 7 => subshells: s,p,d,f
Every subshell => orbitals => max electrons:
- s - 1 - 2
- p - 3 - 6 
- d - 5 - 10
- f - 7 - 14

Only two elements can be on the orbital

### Valence and covalence
The most important electrons in an atom are those on the outer-most edge of the atom(the outer major shell) - they came into FMM
